## **Knowledge Graph & System Design Checklist**

### 1. **Knowledge Graph Design & Ingestion**
- [ ] Can you explain your graph schema and why you modeled it this way?
- [ ] Can you walk through your data ingestion pipeline (from JSON to Neo4j)?
- [ ] How do you handle schema evolution or new data types?
- [ ] How do you ensure data quality and consistency during ingestion?
- [ ] How do you handle large/batch data ingestion?

### 2. **Graph Querying & Reasoning**
- [ ] Can you write and optimize Cypher queries for multi-hop traversals?
- [ ] How do you handle negative queries (e.g., accounts with no bids)?
- [ ] How do you expose graph queries via APIs (FastAPI endpoints)?
- [ ] How do you ensure query performance at scale?

### 3. **API & Microservices**
- [ ] How is your API layer structured? (Dependency injection, modularity)
- [ ] How do you handle errors and exceptions in your API?
- [ ] How do you document and test your API endpoints?

### 4. **ML/NLP Integration**
- [ ] How do you translate natural language to Cypher? (Rule-based and LLM fallback)
- [ ] How do you provide schema/context to the LLM for accurate translation?
- [ ] What are the pros/cons of prompt engineering vs. fine-tuning?
- [ ] How would you fine-tune a model for your use case if needed?
- [ ] How do you evaluate the quality of generated Cypher queries?

### 5. **DevOps, Automation, and Production Readiness**
- [ ] How do you automate setup, ingestion, and deployment? (Makefile, Docker, etc.)
- [ ] How do you manage configuration and secrets?
- [ ] How do you monitor and log your services?
- [ ] How do you ensure reliability and scalability (connection pooling, batching, etc.)?

### 6. **Code Quality & Best Practices**
- [ ] How do you structure your code for maintainability and testability?
- [ ] How do you use DTOs, type hints, and modular classes?
- [ ] How do you write and run unit/integration tests?
- [ ] How do you mentor and review code for junior engineers?

### 7. **Business & Data Understanding**
- [ ] Can you explain how your graph model supports business use cases?
- [ ] How do you handle evolving requirements or new business logic?
- [ ] How do you select the right technology for a given business/data problem?

### 8. **Scaling & Performance**
- [ ] How would you handle multi-terabyte datasets?
- [ ] How do you profile and optimize graph queries?
- [ ] How do you design for scale-out (sharding, clustering, etc.)?

### 9. Advanced Topics
- [ ] How would you implement graph-based ML (e.g., node classification, link prediction)?
- [ ] How would you integrate tabular and graph data for intelligent agents?
- [ ] How would you implement CI/CD for your graph/ML pipelines?
